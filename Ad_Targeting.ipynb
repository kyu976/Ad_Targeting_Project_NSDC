You can think of a Runtime as a code session where everything you create and execute is temporarily stored. This means variables and functions are available between cells if you execute one cell before the other (physical ordering of cells does not matter). This also means that if you delete or change the name of something and re-execute the cell, the old data might still exist in the background. If things aren't making sense, you can always click Runtime -> restart runtime to start over.\n",

In the current digital age, online advertising is a major driver of revenue for businesses, but understanding user engagement with ads remains a challenge. This project is particularly relevant in the context of digital marketing, where companies aim to optimize their ad strategies to increase engagement and conversion rates. By applying data science techniques, we can uncover patterns in user behavior that help marketers make data-driven decisions.\n",

        "Throughout the project, participants will engage in several key tasks: data visualization to explore relationships between variables, data preprocessing (such as feature encoding and scaling), and predictive modeling using logistic regression. They will also analyze model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project is designed for individuals with an intermediate understanding of Python, particularly those familiar with libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. By the end of the project, participants will have developed skills in machine learning model development, feature importance analysis, and model evaluation — key competencies for any aspiring data scientist.\n",
